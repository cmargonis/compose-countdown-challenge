## :scroll: Description
An experimentation using the Canvas to draw an hourglass along with
the new Compose animation APIs to breath some life into it.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
Getting a grasp around the new `DrawScope` was very easy compared with
the low level Canvas API. Overall it was an exciting challenge!
